               DEVICE DRIVER TESTS (DDT) for embedded linux
================================================================================

1) GOALS:
================================================================================
 * Validate the functionality, performance and stability of Device Drivers
   on embedded Linux systems.
 * Validate performance and stability of the whole embedded system.
 * Maximize use of open source software and contribute to improve it.
 * Maximize code reuse across different platforms.
 * Make it easy to support new embedded platforms.

2) ARCHITECTURE HIGHLIGHTS:
================================================================================
 * Based on LTP http://ltp.sourceforge.net/
 * Support dynamic selection/filtering of test cases based on platform
 * Support test parameters overrides based on platform

3) HOW TO ADD NEW DDT TESTS:
================================================================================
 You only need to add files to two directories:
 testcases/ddt: Contains the test logic files (either c code or shell script)
 runtest/ddt  : Contains the test scenario files. It calls the test logic files.
 
 * If your tests requires compiling c sources, create following directory 
   testcases/ddt/<your sources dir name>/
   Add your c sources to the directory created above and make sure that you have
   a top level Makefile. (Check Makefile of existing directories for examples)
   Please note that you don't need to add c sources for external tools (such as 
   iperf, lmbench, etc.), instead external tools should be added to the OE/Arago
   recipe that builds the test filesystem image.
 * If your tests use shell scripts, add the shell scripts to the
   testcases/ddt/scripts/ directory
 * Write a new test scenario file under runtest/ddt/. Also add a new line with
   the name of your new scenario file to scenario_groups/default-ddt.

4) DDT TESTS IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
================================================================================
4.1) TEST CASES
 * Write you test code using c and/or linux shell scripts.
 * Beware that the linux shell script should be compatible with the ash shell
   available in busybox.
 * Avoid hard-coding values that are specific to your platform, instead try to 
   determine the right value to use using the information provided by Linux
   ( /sys and proc/ are your friends)
 * When not possible to determine values dynamically, define default values and
   provide appropriate overrides based on either ARCH, DRIVER, SOC or MACHINE.
   Try to define the override value at the most generic level possible.
   ARCH, DRIVER, SOC and MACHINE variables are exported by ltprun script. 
 * Avoid adding logic to define values dynamically in your c code. If the code
   needs to use different values depending on the platform being tested, then
   make that value a command line argument and write a shell script wraper
   that calls your c executable. The shell script wrapper should use the
   override logic define above to determine the right value to pass to the 
   c executable.
 * Use the default shell script template available at 
   testcases/ddt/scripts/TEMPLATE as a starting point to develop your script.
 * Instead of developing huge shell scripts, try to partition the logic into
   several smaller scripts, each such smaller script should execute some 
   well-defined task and ideally could be used by other people developing 
   tests. Before you start writing scripts, check the available scripts to see
   if the logic you need is already available. Scripts that return a value are 
   named get_*
 * If your script return a single value, use echo to return the value. If your 
   script need to return multiple values, consider breaking it into smaller 
   scripts. If absolutely necessary to return multiple values then write the 
   name=value pairs (one per line) to file descriptor 10. 
   See testcases/ddt/scripts/TEMPLATE for an example.
   

4.2) TEST SCENARIOS
 * Follow LTP guidelines. The test scenario file is basically made of one or 
   more test step lines. Each test step line have following format
   <TAG> <COMMANDS>, where
   TAG is a string that identifies the test step.
     Use following convention to named TAGs so that the test cases can be 
     selectively run based on AREA, SCOPE and/or TYPE.  
     <AREA>_<SCOPE>_<TYPE>_<OPT_ID>,
      i.e. “NAND_S_FUNC_RW_8K”, “NAND_M_PERF_ALL-SIZES” 
     The SCOPE tags are used to indicate the amount of time require to run
     the tests, giving users ability to filter test cases based on estimated
     execution time.
     SCOPE TAGS:
      'XS', 'S', 'M', 'L', 'XL', 'XXL' (for eXtra Small, Small, Medium, etc.
		     Just imagine you are buying clothes ;)
      We used the following rough guidelines to determine test duration based 
      on scope:
        XS:  <= 1  min
        S:   <= 10 mins
        M:   <= 1  hour
        L:   <= 8  hours
        XL:  <= 24 hours
        XXL: <= 1  week
     TYPE TAGS:
      ‘FUNC’, ‘PERF’, ‘STRESS’, ‘USECASE’, ‘COMPLIANCE’, ‘MODULAR’, ‘DOC’
   COMMANDS is a list of one or more shell commands separated by semicolon (;),
     the test step will pass if the commands return zero, otherwise it fails.

 * Use the default test scenario file template available at
   runtest/ddt/TEMPLATE as a starting point to develop your test scenario.

 * Use the @requires annotation to specify ARCH, DRIVER, SOC and/or MACHINE 
   requirements to run the test scenario. You can use (), &&, ||, * to specify
   the test requirements. Examples:
   
   @requires /net/eth/* && spi_master
   To run this test the platform must have an ethernet driver and a 
   spi_master driver

   @requires am3517-evm
   This test can only be run on an am3517 EVM.

   @requires (mmc_host || nand) && armv*
   This test requires mmc or nand drivers and an ARM architecture

 * Use the @setup_requires annotation to specify test setup requirements.
   Some test cases like USB and Video capture requires special peripherals, such as 
   USB flash drives, DVD players, video cameras, etc., to be connected to the DUT.
   Using @setup_requires the test developer highlights such test setup requirements. 
   This information might be used by test automation frameworks to allocate test requests
   to DUTs that have the appropriate peripherals connected to them.
   Please follow the naming conventions identified in section 9) of this document
   if the test scenario needs to identify any setup requirements.

   You can use underscore(_) to seperate multiple @setup_requires. Examples:

   @setup_requires usbhostvideo_usbhostaudio
   This test requires usbhostvideo setup and usbhostaudio setup.
 
5) HOW TO ADD NEW PLATFORMS
================================================================================
 * Copy the default platform file available at platforms/TEMPLATE to 
   platforms/<your platform>. <your platform> name is typically the evm name
 * Please use the following names for platform files and to compare against 
   $MACHINE when writing ltp-ddt scripts:

    am180x-evm   arago-armv7         dm355-evm    dm814x-evm
    am181x-evm   dm365-evm           dm816x-evm
    am3517-evm   beagleboard         dm368-evm    
    am37x-evm    c6a814x-evm         dm37x-evm    omap3evm
    am387x-evm   c6a816x-evm         dm6446-evm   tnetv107x-evm
    am389x-evm   da830-omapl137-evm  dm6467-evm   am335x-evm
    arago-armv5  da850-omapl138-evm  dm6467t-evm  beaglebone

 * Modify your platform file based on the capabilities supported by the new evm
   The platform file identifies the architecture, the SoC, the evm and the
   supported drivers. The supported drivers lines follow a variation of the
   hierarchy used in /sys/class but it is not exactly the same. Hence it is 
   important to use the platforms/TEMPLATE file as your starting point.
   Please note the first 3 lines of the platform file MUST identify, the 
   architecture, SoC and EVM respectively, follow by one or more driver lines.
   Typically the architecture and machine name used in the platform file are
   the ones reported by uname -a.
   Sample platform file:
    armv7l
    am3517
    am3517-evm
    net/eth/davinci_emac
    nand/omap2-nand
    ehci/ehci-omap
    i2c-adapter/i2c_omap
    mmc_host/mmci-omap-hs
    rtc/rtc-s35390a
    watchdog/omap_wdt
    ...
 * You might need to define new override values for your new platform in some
   test case files (see section 4.1 above for details). A reasonable strategy
   is to try to run an existing test plan and then analyze the test failures
   to determine probable test cases where you need to define override values.  

6) Building LTP-DDT
================================================================================

6.1) Environment Setup for LTP-DDT build
================================================================================
 In order to cross compile LTP-DDT, a cross-compiler tool-chain is required.
 We typically use either Linaro Toolchain or Arago Toolchain.
 To Install Linaro toolchain, please see http://arago-project.org/wiki/index.php/Setting_Up_Build_Environment#Cross-compile_toolchain
 To Install Arago toolchain:
 wget and untar http://software-dl.ti.com/sdoemb/sdoemb_public_sw/arago_toolchain/2011_09/exports/arago-2011.09-armv7a-linux-gnueabi-sdk.tar.bz2 
 Set the environment variable PATH to contain the binaries of the toolchain cross-compiler tool-chain.
     For example, in bash: 
	     $ export PATH=/opt/arago-2011.09/armv7a/bin:$PATH 
 Test if PATH is set properly by running following command 
  * For Arago Toolchain
    $ arm-arago-linux-gnueabi-gcc -v
  * For Linaro Toolchain
    $ arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -v

6.2) HOW TO CROSS-COMPILE AND INSTALL
================================================================================
 Note: CROSS_COMPILE may be set differently than the examples showing in this section.
   for Arago Toolchain: CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-;
   for Linaro Toolchain: CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-

 == Checks before compilation ==
 * Update testcases/ddt/alsa_test_suite/Makefile with alsa include and 
   lib paths.
   For example:
	  ALSA_INCPATH=/home/useraccount/usr/include
	  ALSA_LIBPATH=/home/useraccount/usr/lib
   (In case the filesystem does not contain ALSA include and lib refer step 7 
    for installation)
    NOTE: Alternatively instead of updating the Makefile user can supply 
          ALSA_INCPATH and  ALSA_LIBPATH as arguements to make 
 * cd to kernel diretory and then do headers_install in kernel install directory
       e.g.
        $cd linux-xx.xx.xx.xx
        $make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- distclean
        $make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- headers_install

 == Builds steps ==
make autotools

export CROSS_COMPILER=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
export CC=${CROSS_COMPILER}gcc
export LD=${CROSS_COMPILER}ld
export AR=${CROSS_COMPILER}ar
export STRIP=${CROSS_COMPILER}strip
export RANLIB=${CROSS_COMPILER}ranlib

./configure --host=arm-linux-gnueabihf

make SKIP_IDCHECK=1 KERNEL_USR_INC=/opt/lcpd/git_repos/ti-linux-kernel/usr/include CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- clean

make SKIP_IDCHECK=1 KERNEL_USR_INC=/opt/lcpd/git_repos/ti-linux-kernel/usr/include CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-

 == Install Step ==
   $ sudo make DESTDIR=<destination directory> SKIP_IDCHECK=1 PLATFORM=<Platform name> install
   For example:
   $sudo make DESTDIR=/opt/filesystem/home/root/ltp-ddt-install SKIP_IDCHECK=1 PLATFORM=am335x-evm install

For more information about autotools, please check the tutorial to GNU MAKE tools
http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/index.html#SEC_Contents

7) HOW TO INSTALL ALSA INCLUDES AND LIBS
   Install following packages on to your filesystem
       	alsa-dev (e.g. alsa-dev_1.0.18-r0.1_armv5te.ipk)
	alsa-lib-dev (e.g. alsa-lib-dev_1.0.18-r0.1_armv5te.ipk)
	libasound2 (e.g. libasound2_1.0.18-r0.1_armv5te.ipk)
   To unpack the .ipk files use following commands
	$ ar -p alsa-dev_1.0.18-r0.1_armv5te.ipk data.tar.gz | tar -zx
	$ ar -p libasound2_1.0.18-r0.1_armv5te.ipk data.tar.gz | tar -zx
	$ ar -p alsa-lib-dev_1.0.18-r0.1_armv5te.ipk data.tar.gz | tar -zx
   (http://arago-project.org/wiki/index.php/Crosscompiling_Outside_of_Arago)

8) HOW TO RUN TESTS
================================================================================
 * Run DDT tests the same way you run LTP tests. Use ltprun program and pass to
   it the test scenario file in the runtest directory (option -f) to run and the
   platform (option -P) to use. For example:
     ./runltp -P am335x-evm -f ddt/lmbench
   The platform name specified with -P option must exist in the platforms/ dir.
   It is also possible to run tests without -P option, in such case the ltprun
   script won't filter test cases and it is possible that tests cases not 
   supported by the platform you are running on will be called.
 * In addition to selecting test scenarios using -f option, users can also 
   filter test cases using -s PATTERN and -S SKIPFILE options. These options
   select or skip test cases based on the test case TAG specified in the test
   scenario file.
 * The runltp script have lot of options. Some useful ones for stress tests are:
   -t DURATION: Define duration of the test in s,m,h,d.
   -x INSTANCES: Run multiple test instances in parallel.
   -c <options>: Run test under additional background CPU load
   -D <options>: Run test under additional background load on Secondary storage
   -m <options>: Run test under additional background load on Main memory
   -i <options>: Run test under additional background load on IO Bus
   -n          : Run test with network traffic in background.

9) @setup_requires Naming Conventions
================================================================================
As discussed in section 4.2 above, @setup_requires is used to highlight test scenarios' setup
requirements. The following @setup_requires tags are currently defined.
If required, please feel free to define a new tag below and send a patch to the Opentest mailing list.

* Video Related:
usbhostmsc, usbhosthid_mouse, usbhosthid_keyboard, usbhostaudio, usbhostvideo, usbslavefbs, usbslavecdc, usbslaverndis, usbslaveasync

* USB Related:
usbhostmsc, usbhosthid, usbhostaudio, usbhostvideo, usbslavefbs, usbslavecdc, usbslaverndis, usbslaveasync

* Storage Related:
sd, sdhc, mmc, sata

10) How to merge LTP to LTP-DDT
================================================================================
* fetch LTP using LTP release label. Ex: ltp-20150119
git fetch https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp master:new_branch
git checkout new_branch
git checkout -b ltp-20150119 20150119

* merge LTP release into 'ltp' branch
git checkout ltp
git merge -X theirs ltp-20150119 
git status
resolve conflicts if there is any
git commit

* optional: delete files which were deleted in LTP from 'ltp' branch
git diff ltp..ltp-20150119 --summary > diff_between_ltp_and_ltp-20150119.txt
write a script to delete and 'git rm' the files which are being deleted by LTP
git commit

* merge ltp branch to 'next' branch
git checkout next
git merge ltp
git status

Usually, there are some conflicts. Copy 'Unmerged paths' part to a seperate file; 
then
# First, use the below to resolve the conflicts:
# For 'testcases/ddt/Makefile' use 'git checkout --ours' to merge
# For others, use 'git checkout --theirs' to resolove the conflicts
#
# Then, use 'git add/rm' to commit
# For 'deleted by them', use 'git rm' to remove those files
# For 'added by us', use 'git rm' to remove them if they are not added by ltp-ddt
# For others, use 'git add' to add those files
#
# For 'runltp', need manually resolve the conflict and add it.
git commit

* optional: compare files between 'next' and 'ltp' and overwrite the files in 'next' for non-ddt files if there is any diff

* build/test new ltp-ddt
