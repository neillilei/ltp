#	CAN Modular test
# @desc
#	CAN modular tests. No physical cables are required to run this test.
#	EVM needs to be in the right profile which supports the pinmux for
#	CAN. This comment applies to am335x-evm which requires EVM to be in
#	profile 1. Profile 1 supports CAN instead of wlan on this EVM.
#       Tests that CAN interface exists and driver is built as module
# @requires can
